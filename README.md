# CSC-Hacks-2021

## Project Description
@Arachnophobe404 just had a long day at work and all they want to do is scroll through their social media profile. But, much to their dismay, they forgot their password! This is the worst day ever! Help them find their password to turn their frown upside down.

Our CSC Hacks project is a riddle-based website game in which the user is tasked with figuring out a password to a social media profile. The game is played by searching around the website and using details found on other related accounts to eventually find the answers to some password recovery questions, after which you will figure out the password.

As people who have had very little experience with coding before this, our main goal was just to learn as much as possible about some of the simpler languages (namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) while also making something cool and fun to interact with. 


## MVP Demo
To view our project, clone our repository and open the index.html file. While we are still working on making the website functional, we would appreciate if you would look at what we have so far. Let us know what you think and if you have any tips for us at this link: https://forms.gle/StimMEPDWZs3R4337. 
Thank you!

So far, we have a basic layout for the website. Most of the information such as the description boxes and pictures is in place of what will go there later. We will add some more profile pages and try to add a comment section that will include additional clues. The log-in link will eventually open to another webpage to congratulate the user for solving the puzzle.
