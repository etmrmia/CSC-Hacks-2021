# CSC-Hacks-2021

## Project Description
Arachnophobe404 just had a long day at work and all they want to do is scroll through their social media profile. But, much to their dismay, they forgot their password! This is the worst day ever! Help them find their password to turn their frown upside down.

Our CSC Hacks project is a riddle-based website game in which the user is tasked with figuring out a password to a social media profile. The game is played by searching around the website and using details found on other related accounts to eventually find the answers to some password recovery questions, after which you will figure out the password.
